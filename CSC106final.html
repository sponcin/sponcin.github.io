	<p>The final project that I created with my partner, Leah, is called "Let's Draw". It is a fun drawing app that consists of 4 activities that include colors and drawing. 
       
       <br>
       
       The splash screen consists of three buttons - Activities to choose which of the four you would like to start with, Play Through to start at the beginning and run through the game and finally a Help button to learn how to do each activity. To play through the game, you will start off with the "Fresh Fruit" activity. 
       
       <br>
       
       <b>Fresh Fruit</b> has three fruits on the screen that the user needs to color in with the correct color. At the top of each screen is a set of crayons to choose your color from. The apple can be colored red, but if you color it a different color, it will tell you at the bottom which color you should fill it in with. The same process works for the orange and grapes. At the bottom of each activity there is a "back", "?", and "next" button. Clicking the back button brings you to the previous scene and the next button brings you to the next scene. The ? button lets you review the instructions if you forgot how to do the activity. 
       
       <br>
       
       The next activity is <b>Pick and Fill</b> where you will pick colors to fill in a house and yard.
       
       <br>
       
       The third activity is <b>Frost a Cake</b> where you can color in and decorate a cake. You can also choose the size of your crayon when decorating the cake.
       
       <br>
       
       The final activity is <b>Free Draw</b> where you can draw anything you want with your mouse. You can again use the crayons at the top to pick your color as well as choose the size of your crayon to draw with by clicking the sizes at the bottom of the screen.
