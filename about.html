	     Hello, kind reader, and welcome to the portion of my programming portfolio where I would like to introduce myself. My name is Stephanie and am a native Rhode Islander and a 2016 URI alum. I am currently a Textile Designer and a volunteer for <a href="https://tenlivescatrescue.org/" target="_blank">Ten Lives Cat Rescue</a> which is a 501(c)(3) non profit cat rescue. <br><br>
	     
	     I love cats and currenty have two of my own, Daphne and Velma, who were both adopted from <strong>Ten Lives Cat Rescue</strong> in 2019 as kittens. Some of my hobbies include sewing, knitting and crocheting. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtAfi5CVvlbVKUdZwMg6KHg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel where I share knit and crochet patterns for free! Below are some images of my most recent creations, including a cat couch that will be auctioned off in April 2021 for <strong>Ten Lives</strong>. I also recently got back into reading in my free time and am currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue">The Invisible Life of Addie Larue</a>. 
	     <br><br>
	     I also have a B.A. in French and studied abroad in Paris at Sorbonne University for the summer of 2015. I was able to live with a host family and travel with others in the study abroad program to Normandie, the Loire Valley, London and Munich. It was an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!
