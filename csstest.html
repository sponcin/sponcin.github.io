     <p>Welcome to my page! This is my webpage I am working on for CSC 106 The Joy of Programming. I will be posting my projects and designing this website as I go. <br>
	     I have some experience with HTML and CSS thanks to playing <strong>Neopets</strong> when I was in the fourth grade. It was harder back then to learn how to code so I didn't get that far. Just the basics like adding an image, links, changing colors etc. I can't wait to learn more and show you what I learn in this class!
